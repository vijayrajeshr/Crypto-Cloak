# 🔐 CryptoCloak: NFT-Based Secure File Access & Destruction

## 🚀 Overview
**CryptoCloak** is a decentralized Digital Rights Management (DRM) system developed by our team that uses **self-destructing NFTs** to enable **time-limited, secure access** to encrypted digital assets. Designed for e-learning, media streaming, and enterprise data management, this system eliminates unauthorized redistribution by leveraging the power of **blockchain**, **AES-256 encryption**, and **decentralized storage**.

## 🧠 Abstract
CryptoCloak introduces a novel DRM system utilizing **self-destructing NFTs** to provide **time-bound access** to encrypted files. By bundling encrypted files and decryption keys within NFTs and using **smart contracts** to manage expiration, the system offers a tamper-evident, immutable access model. **AES-256 encryption**, **IPFS/Arweave** decentralized storage, and a **Kivy-based UI** ensure both strong security and user accessibility. The system also integrates scalability solutions (Layer-2, gasless transactions) and explores future enhancements like **zero-knowledge proofs** for privacy.
